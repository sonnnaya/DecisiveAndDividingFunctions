# Decisive and dividing functions
Here are described and implemented two related to each other classification methods based on using decisive and dividing functions respectively. 
By decisive function, we mean a class function that decides whether the input image (its argument) belongs to this class. 
Accordingly, the dividing function is a boundary that separates two classes in pairs.
